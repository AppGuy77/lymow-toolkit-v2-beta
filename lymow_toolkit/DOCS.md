# Lymow Toolkit — Home Assistant App (Add-on)

The full Lymow Toolkit dashboard, running as a Home Assistant app: live map with accurate
coverage paint, per-zone cutting settings, scheduler and calendar, freshness and RTK heat maps,
fault auto-recovery, mow history, remote control, and more — for the Lymow One robotic mower.

## Installation

> Home Assistant **2026.2** renamed **Add-ons** to **Apps**. On an older version, read
> **Add-ons** and **Add-on Store** wherever this page says **Apps** and **App Store** — the
> steps are identical.

1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Apps**, then select **Install app**.
   *(Before 2026.2: **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.)* You can also
   [open the app store on your instance directly](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/).
2. Open the **⋮** menu (top right) → **Repositories**, paste this URL, and click **Add**:

   `https://github.com/AppGuy77/lymow-toolkit-downloads`

3. Find **Lymow Toolkit** in the store list (refresh the page if it doesn't appear) and click
   **Install**. The app is downloaded ready-made for your machine — the first install can take a few minutes on a
   Raspberry Pi. Later updates are much faster.
4. Click **Start**, then **Open Web UI** and sign in with your Lymow account (the same email and
   password as the official app). Prefer **"Sign in with Google"**? It opens an on-box browser
   right inside the dashboard (the app bundles Firefox for this) — sign in to Google there and
   it finishes on its own, no copy/paste. On 32-bit ARM boards (older Raspberry Pi OS installs)
   no on-box browser exists, so Google sign-in is unavailable there — use email and password.

## Updates

When a new toolkit version is released, Home Assistant shows an **Update** button on the app's
page. The Toolkit also shows a ⚠️ in its own header when one is out. Your login, settings, and
backups are stored in the app's persistent data folder and survive every update and rebuild.

To update without pressing anything, turn on **Auto update** on this add-on's page. **Watchdog**,
on the same page, restarts the add-on if it ever stops — worth having on for a mower that is being
monitored.

The Toolkit cannot update itself here, and that is deliberate: add-on updates belong to
Supervisor, which already knows how to do them safely.

## Notes

- **Sidebar panel (ingress):** the Toolkit appears in Home Assistant's own sidebar and opens
  there — no port to type, no second password, and it works through Nabu Casa remote access. You
  are already signed in to Home Assistant, so the Toolkit does not ask again.

- **Port:** the dashboard listens on port 8787 (changeable on the app's Configuration tab under
  Network). Anything on your network can reach `http://<home-assistant-ip>:8787`.
- **Keep it running:** scheduled mows, fault auto-recovery, and history capture run from the
  app — leave it started (Start on boot is enabled by default).
- **HA Container / Core users:** apps (add-ons) require Home Assistant OS or Supervised. On plain
  Docker installs, run the standalone Docker bundle from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/AppGuy77/lymow-toolkit-downloads/releases/latest) instead —
  it is the same application.
